# My First MD Assignment

This is how to code a bit of basic **html**:
___
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>MD Assignment No. 1</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1>Md Assignment No .1</h1>
            <p>This is my first MD assignment. Funnily      enough, I'm actually using html. Maybe I should stop. But first, here's a list of things to do.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MD Assignment No. 2</li>
                <li>MD Assignment No. 3</li>
                <li>Have Lunch</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now, I'll show you what a bit of **CSS** looks like:
___
```
div {
background-color: white;
border: 1px solid black;
}

h1 {
color: brown;
font-family: Cambria;
font-weight: bold;
}
```
